# AI-MultiAgent-Pathfinding-and-Decision-Systems
A collection of three AI projects exploring multi-agent systems, pathfinding algorithms, and intelligent decision-making using A*, Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, and reinforcement learning. Implemented in Python with thorough performance evaluations and dynamic environment simulations.


## Overview

This repository contains three independent but thematically connected AI projects focused on:
- **Pathfinding in dynamic environments** (Project 1)
- **Adversarial decision-making using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning** (Project 2)
- **Reinforcement learning for optimal action strategies in grid-world** (Project 3)

Each project explores a key area in artificial intelligence, offering unique problem formulations, algorithmic solutions, and detailed performance evaluations.
